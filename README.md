# PyMongoArrow: Bridging the Gap Between MongoDB and Your Data Analysis App

This repo contains sample code for a [PyMongoArrow tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/quickstart/pymongoarrow-and-data-analysis).
All of the code, with the instructions for running it, are contained within the [notebook](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/pymongoarrow-sample-code/blob/main/PyMongoArrow%20Demo.ipynb) itself.
